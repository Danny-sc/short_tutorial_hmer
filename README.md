# Aim of the Short Tutorial

The hmer package allows you to efficiently implement the Bayes Linear emulation and history matching process, a calibration method that has been successfully employed in several sciences (epidemiology, cosmology, climate science, systems biology, geology, energy systems etc.).

This tutorial offers a short introduction to history matching with emulation and to the main functionality of the hmer package, using a simple example of an epidemiological model. You will be invited to carry out a series of tasks (see “Task” boxes) which will enhance your understanding of the package and its tools. 
Thanks to these activities, you will learn to calibrate deterministic models using history matching and model emulation. 

For more detailed resources on the calibration of deterministic models, please take a look at:

-[Tutorial 1](https://danny-sc.github.io/Tutorial_1/), which introduces the history matching with emulation framework with a one-dimensional example,

-[Deterministic Workshop](https://danny-sc.github.io/Tutorial_1/), which offers a more in-depth introduction to the functionality of the hmer package and shows how to use your judgement to customise the process.
